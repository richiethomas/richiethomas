# Me In 10 Seconds

I'm currently an [improviser](https://wgimprovschool.com/), an introvert, a [world traveler](https://nomadlist.com/@toomanyrichies), and a software engineer.

I'm originally from California, currently traveling throughout Latin America.  I've previously lived in San Francisco, Brooklyn, Chicago, Shanghai, Los Angeles, and Copenhagen.

# What I'm Doing Now

I'm currently interested in making the programming community a more welcoming place for beginners.  When I was learning to code, people always told me to "read the fucking manual", but the manual was more often than not a document written for people who were already experts.  That's a problem that I want to solve.

My current attempt at that is tentatively titled "The Impostor's Guide To Programming".  I'm fresh off of finishing [Chip and Dan Heath's amazing book "Made To Stick"](https://www.amazon.com/Made-Stick-Ideas-Survive-Others-ebook/dp/B000N2HCKQ/), and I want to take the principles I learned from this book and apply them toward teaching beginners how to code.
