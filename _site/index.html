<p>I’m currently an <a href="https://wgimprovschool.com/">improviser</a>, an introvert, a <a href="https://nomadlist.com/@toomanyrichies">world traveler</a>, and a software engineer.</p>

<p>I’m originally from California, currently traveling throughout Latin America.  I’ve previously lived in San Francisco, Brooklyn, Chicago, Shanghai, Los Angeles, and Copenhagen.</p>

<h1 id="what-im-doing-now">What I’m Doing Now</h1>

<p>I’m currently interested in making the programming community a more welcoming place for beginners.  When I was learning to code, people always told me to “read the fucking manual”, but the manual was more often than not a document written for people who were already experts.  That’s a problem that I want to solve.</p>

<p>My current attempt at that is tentatively titled “The Impostor’s Guide To Programming”.  I’m fresh off of finishing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Made-Stick-Ideas-Survive-Others-ebook/dp/B000N2HCKQ/">Chip and Dan Heath’s amazing book “Made To Stick”</a>, and I want to take the principles I learned from this book and apply them toward teaching beginners how to code.</p>
